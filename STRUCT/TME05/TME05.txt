In this practical you will learn how to select and use appropriate tools for predicting the
structure of a protein. You will work with the Influenza A virus (A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1)).
Each group will choose one protein sequence to work with, among those reported at the end of
this document. No complete structure exists today for these proteins. 

How many residues are in the protein sequence you have chosen (query sequence)?

Exercice - 1 Search the pdb database using NCBI's Blast server

Go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ and perform a blastp search of the query sequence against the PDB database.

1- What is the E-value of the top-scoring hit?



2- Is the top-scoring hit statistically signicant (do you believe the result)?

3- Which region of your sequence is aligned to the top-scoring template?
a- How many residues are in that region?
b- How many hits do you get with an E-value of less than 0.05?
4- Which region(s) of the query sequence is aligned to a template with an E-value of less than 0.05?
a- How many residues are in those regions?
5- For each of the regions where you did not nd a signicant hit, try to go through the dierent
steps of this exercise again. If you got no hits at all go to the next exercise.
Exercice - 2 Use PSI-Blast to nd a hit
If you did not nd a statistically signicant hit try PSI-Blast . Once again, go to http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ and click on "protein BLAST (blastp)". Under "Program Selection"
choose the "PSI-BLAST (Position-Specic Iterated BLAST)" option. Paste in your sequence, leave
all other options as they are, and press "BLAST" as before.
1- How many hits with a E-value of less than 0.05 do you get?
2- You can nd out the total number of hits by looking at the top of the results page. The
web-based Blast has a limit on 500 hits that it shows. Is this limit reached?
